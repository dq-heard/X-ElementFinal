        We are X-Element LLC ("Company," "we," "us," "our"), a company
        registered in __________ at __________, Junction City, KS, __________.
      </p>

      <p>
        We operate the website

          ><strong>https://teamxelement.com/</strong></a
        >
        (the "Site"), as well as any other related products and services that
        refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively,
        the "Services").
      </p>

      <p>
        These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between
        you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and X-Element
        LLC, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that
        by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be
        bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE
        LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES
        AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
      </p>

      <p>
        Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
        Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by
        reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes
        or modifications to these Legal Terms from time to time. We will alert
        you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal
        Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such
        change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal
        Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be
        deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in
        any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the
        date such revised Legal Terms are posted.
      </p>

      <p>
        All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside
        (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be

      <h3>1. OUR SERVICES</h3>

      <p>
        The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
        distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
        country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
        regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
        within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
        choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if
        and to the extent local laws are applicable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
        regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so
        if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use
        the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate
        the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
